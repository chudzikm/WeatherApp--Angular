# WeatherApp

#### **Check online here** --> https://chudzikmagda.github.io/WeatherApp-Angular/

Weather application based on the free version of API from Weatherbit.io (I used 2 APIs to get the data for the current weather and the daily forecast). You can check the current weather and the forecast for the next 16 days by using the name of your city or your geolocation.

#### **Technology used:** Angular, TypeScript, HTML, SASS, BEM.
